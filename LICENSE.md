 As long as that is done, I have no issues whatsoever. If this project inspires you, great. I love that. Just remember    
 how easy it is to create your own unique version that is not identifiable as derivitive of this work. And if you are not    
 able to do so, then you should be studying with your own projects. With all due respect, those are my only terms.     
 If you do something dumb using my code, it was done on your own accord. Any direct derivation of this project is    
 outside of the scope of these terms without explicit consent. And if not, its not my business anyways.
 
Thanks, my regards,
